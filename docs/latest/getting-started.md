# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to Tabris.js, the framework for developing native cross-platform apps in JavaScript. This guide will help you create the foundation of a Tabris.js app and test it on a mobile device connected to your development machine.

> <img align="left" src="img/note.png"> <i> If you want to test a code snippet on your mobile device without creating an app on your development machine, check out the [Tabris.js Playground](https://tabrisjs.com/playground) instead.</i>

## What you need:

All you need is an Android and/or iOS device, connected to the same network as your development machine.

## Setting up the development machine

The following software needs to be installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), ([installation guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node))
- [Tabris CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tabris-cli) (type `npm install -g tabris-cli`)
- A text editor or JavaScript IDE of your choice

## Setting up the mobile device:

- Download the Tabris.js 2 Developer App from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eclipsesource.tabrisjs2) / [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tabris.js-2/id1166468326?mt=8).
- Start the app and (optional) log in with your GitHub account.
- If you need it, there is also a separate [tutorial](developer-app.md) for the Developer App.

## Create your first app

### Option 1: Setting up your project manually

Create a directory with two files:

#### package.json
```json
{
  "main": "app.js",
  "dependencies": {
    "tabris": "^2.0.0-beta2"
  }
}
```

#### app.js

```js
new tabris.TextView({
  centerX: 0, centerY: 0,
  text: "My First App"
}).appendTo(tabris.ui.contentView);
```

Run `npm install` in this directory to install the tabris module.

### Option 2: Setting up your project with the tabris-cli

You can also use the _Tabris CLI_ to create your project. It can not only create the basic files as described above, but also prepare your project for the build process and set up ES6 or TypeScript support.

To install the tabris-cli, use npm:

    npm install -g tabris-cli

Once installed, `cd` to an empty project directory and run `tabris init`. The tabris-cli will ask you a number of questions including the project name and version. The generator will also ask you if you would like to create a _Basic JS App_, _ES6 App_ or a _TypeScript App_. This tutorial assumes you select a _Basic JS App_ to get started.

## Run the app

- In the project directory, type `tabris serve`. Keep the server running as long as you are testing your app.
- In the Developer App, go to the URL tab and enter `http://<development-machine-ip-address>:8080/`
- Tap *Connect*.

The Developer App will now download the script and execute it on your mobile device. Swipe from the right edge of the screen to open the developer console, which lets you restart the script or go back to the Developer App.

Now you can start developing. You may want to have a look at the rest of the documentation and the Tabris.js snippets.

## Publishing your app

For submission to the App / Play Stores you will need to bundle, brand and build your app, either using the free online build service (on [tabrisjs.com](http://tabrisjs.com)) or using local build tools. This process is explained in [Build your app](build.md).
