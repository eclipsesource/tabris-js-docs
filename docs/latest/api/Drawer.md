# Drawer

A drawer that can be swiped in from the left edge of the screen. There's only a single instance that can be accessed via `tabris.ui.drawer`. The drawer is locked by default. To use it in an application, set the property `locked` to `false`. The drawer can contain any kind of widgets.

Extends [Composite](Composite.md)

## Methods

### close()

**Returns:** *this*

Closes the drawer.

### open()

**Returns:** *this*

Opens the drawer. It may be useful to call this method on first startup, so that users notice the drawer and its contents.


## Properties

### enabled

Type: *boolean*, default: `false`

Controls whether the drawer can be opened and closed. When set to `false`, the drawer cannot be opened and calls to `drawer.open()` will be ignored.

### win_displayMode

Type: *string*, supported values: `overlay`, `compactOverlay`, `inline`, `compactInline`, default: `overlay`

Controls how the drawer integrates in to its targetView. 

- `overlay` completely hides the drawer when closed and overlays other content when opend.
- `compactOverlay` makes the drawer partially visible when closed so a 48px wide bar remains side-by-side with the targetViews other content. If a drawer-action controls the drawer it is placed inside this bar. When the drawer is opend its remaining width overlays the targetViews other content.
- `inline` completely hides the drawer when closed, but shows it side-by-side with the targetView when opend. The drawer does not close automatically in this mode.
- `compactInline` makes the drawer partially visible when closed (like `compactOverlay`), but shows it side-by-side with the targetView when opend (like `inline`).

Available only on windows.

### win_targetView

Type: *[Widget](Widget.md)*, default: ``tabris.ui``

This property may be set to an instance of NavigationView to make its drawer-action open/close the drawer. It also integrates the drawer into the NavigationView layout. When not set to NavigationView instance the property defaults to `tabris.ui`. Other widgets are not supported. Available only on Windows.


## Events

### close
Fired when the drawer is closed and has reached its resting position.


### open
Fired when the drawer is opened and has reached its resting position.

```js
// Enable the drawer and append a widget to it

var drawer = tabris.ui.drawer;

drawer.enabled = true;

drawer.on('open', function() {
  console.log('drawer opened');
}).on('close', function() {
  console.log('drawer closed');
});

var arrow = String.fromCharCode(8592);
createLabel(arrow + ' Swipe from left or tap here').on('tap', function() {
  drawer.open();
}).appendTo(tabris.ui.contentView);

createLabel('Thank you!').on('tap', function() {
  drawer.close();
}).appendTo(drawer);

function createLabel(text) {
  return new tabris.TextView({
    left: 10, centerY: 0,
    text: text,
    font: '22px Arial'
  });
