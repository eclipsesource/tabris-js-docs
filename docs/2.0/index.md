# Introduction

Tabris.js is a mobile framework that lets you develop native apps for iOS, Android and Windows from a single code base written entirely in JavaScript.
It provides access to native widgets and functions, delivering native performance and look & feel.
Tabris.js has been crafted with compatibility and extensibility in mind.
The framework exposes various well-known JavaScript APIs such as [Timers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout), [Console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console), [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), and [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket).
You can use existing JavaScript libraries from the [npm](http://npmjs.com/) ecosystem and [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/plugins/) plug-ins to access device functions that are not accessible by Tabris.js directly.

## Getting Started

You can try out Tabris.js without installing anything on your computer.
Install the [Tabris.js Developer App](developer-app.md) on your device and browse through the included examples.
You can also edit the source code of a simple Tabris.js app online in the [Tabris.js Playground](https://tabrisjs.com/playground) and load it via the Developer App.

To really start developing a full fledged Tabris.js app, follow the [Quick Start Guide](getting-started.md).
We also have an excellent [ebook](https://tabrisjs.com/downloads/ebook/tabrisjs-2.0.0-rc2.pdf) that explains how to create, deploy and test your first Tabris.js app.
