# The Widget Tree

The UI of a Tabris.js app consists of native [Widgets](widget-basics.md). These widgets are implemented in native code, and represented by JavaScript objects. Every widget must have a parent to become visible on the screen. You can add a widget to a parent widget using its `appendTo` method.

## The UI Root

The top-level parent for all widgets is represented by the object `tabris.ui`. This object contains a number of fixed children, that represent different parts of the app's user interface:

- `tabris.ui.statusBar` - shows the time and some system status icons
- `tabris.ui.navigationBar` - contains the *Back*, *Home*, etc. buttons on Android
- `tabris.ui.contentView` - contains the app's main UI
- `tabris.ui.drawer` - can be swiped in from the left

Widgets can be added to the content view, and optionally to the drawer.

## The Status Bar

The status bar is the small area on the top of the screen that displays notifications, status icons and the time. The object [tabris.ui.statusBar](../api/StatusBar.md) can be used to control different aspects of its look and feel, such as background color and visibility.

## The Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is the area that contains the *Back*, *Home*, etc. buttons on Android. The object [tabris.ui.navigationBar](../api/NavigationBar.md) can be used to control its background color and visibility.

## The Content View

The content view is the container for the widgets that constitute the app's main UI. It covers the entire app area. Widgets can be appended directly to the content view.

![ContentView](img/contentview.png)

```js
new tabris.Button({
  left: 16, top: 16
}).appendTo(tabris.ui.contentView);
```

## The Drawer

The "drawer" is a common component of mobile applications. It's a container that can be slid in from the left edge of the screen, often used for top-level navigation. In Tabris.js, this drawer is disabled by default. To use it in an application, you have to enable it:

![Drawer](img/drawer.png)

```js
tabris.ui.drawer.enabled = true;
```

The drawer can be opened by a swipe from the left edge of the screen or by tapping the action on the left side of a NavigationView (so called "burger menu"). To open and close the drawer programmatically, you can use its `open()` and `close()` methods, respectively.

A drawer may contain any kind of widgets:

```js
new tabris.ImageView({
  left: 16, top: 16, right: 16,
  image {src: 'buddy-icon.png'}
}).appendTo(tabris.ui.drawer);
```

## Navigation Patters

Common navigation patterns for apps are based on pages or on tabs. Both approaches can also be combined.

### Using Pages

To implement a page navigation pattern, you can use a fullscreen [NavigationView](api/NavigationView.md). A navigation view contains [Pages](api/Page.md) that are arranged on a stack, so that only the topmost page is visible. A header displays the current page's title and a button to navigate back to the previous page.

```js
var navigationView = new tabris.NavigationView({
  left: 0, top: 0, right: 0, bottom: 0
}).appendTo(tabris.ui.contentView);
```

When a new page is appended to the NavigationView, it is put on top and becomes visible:

```js
new tabris.Page({
  title: "My Page"
}).appendTo(navigationView);
```

On back navigation, the topmost page will be disposed. Likewise, you can call `dispose()` on a page to remove it from the stack. When a page is removed that is not the topmost page, all pages on top will be disposed and removed as well.

On Android, the system back button can also be used to navigate back.

### Using Tabs

The main UI of an app can also be organized in tabs. To do so, use a fullscreen [TabFolder](api/TabFolder.md) as top-level container. A tab folder contains [Tabs](api/Tab.md) that are displayed at the bottom on iOS and at the top on Android.

```js
var tabFolder = new tabris.TabFolder({
  left: 0, top: 0, right: 0, bottom: 0
}).appendTo(tabris.ui.contentView);
new tabris.Tab({
  title: 'Cart',
  image: {src: 'cart.png'}
}).appendTo(tabFolder);
```
