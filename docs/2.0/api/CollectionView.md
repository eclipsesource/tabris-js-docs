## Properties

### cellType

Type: *string|((item: any) => string)*

The name of the cell type to use for a given item. This name will be passed to the `initializeCell` and `itemHeight` functions. Cells will be reused only by items that require the same cell type. If set to a function, this function will be called for every item, providing the item as a parameter, and must return a name for the cell type to use for the given item.

### columnCount

Type: *number*, default: `1`

The number of columns to display in the collection view. If set to a value `n > 1`, each row will contain `n` items. The available space will be equally distributed between columns.

### firstVisibleIndex

**read-only**<br/>
Type: *number*

The first item that is currently visible on screen.

### initializeCell

Type: *(cell: Cell, cellType: string) => void*

A callback used to initialize a collection cell by attaching widget and *change:item* listener. Cells are created by the framework and recycled on scrolling.<br/>This property can only be set on widget creation. Once set, it cannot be changed anymore.

### itemHeight

Type: *number|((item: any, cellType: string) => number)*

The height of a collection cell. If set to a function, this function will be called for every item, providing the item and the cell type as parameters, and must return the item height for the given item.

### items

Type: *any[]*

An array of data items to be displayed by the collection view. For dynamic content, use the methods `insert` and `remove` instead of setting this property directly.

### lastVisibleIndex

**read-only**<br/>
Type: *number*

The last item that is currently visible on screen.

### refreshEnabled

Type: *boolean*, default: `false`

Enables the user to trigger a refresh by using the pull-to-refresh gesture.

### refreshIndicator

Type: *boolean*, default: `false`

Whether the refresh indicator is currently visible. Will be set to `true` when a *refresh* event is triggered. Reset it to `false` when the refresh is finished.

### refreshMessage

Type: *string*, default: `""`

The message text displayed together with the refresh indicator. Currently not supported on Android.

      alignment: 'center'
    }).appendTo(cell);
    cell.on('change:item', function({value: person}) {
